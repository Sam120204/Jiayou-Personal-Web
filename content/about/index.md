Hello! I'm Jiayou (Sam) Zhong, I am from Wuhan, the River City located in the central part of China. I studied abroad in Mississauga, Canada when I was in grade 10, and now I study CS at University of Waterloo!

I'm a creative and goal-oriented individual, known for punctuality, dedication, and strong ethics. With high energy and sharp communication skills, I excel in organization and meticulous attention to detail.

I am pursuing my Bachelor from [University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) in Computer Science between 2022 and 2026 in Canada.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
